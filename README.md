Everything to do with my APL language journey.

APL is an esoteric language: a programming language that wasn't made to be used mainstream, with their reasons depending on their author.
APL is known for its character typography, creating very concise, and baffling, code. It's a language based around functions and arrays, perfect for a mathematician.

All code here was made using the Dyalog APL IDE.
